# NATVENT-N2O-py
Python functions for calculating N2O emission from measurements made on naturally ventilated dairy barns
One module "N2O_emission_for_all_farms.py" with functions used in different scripts containing data from
7 different naturally ventilated dairy barns for two measurements periods one during a summer period and one 
during a winter period = 14 different scripts 
The scripts was used to characterize N2O emissions from barns with different manure handling systems and under
different environmental conditions (summer and winter period). The emission calculation is based on using CO2 as
a natural tracer gas for using the tracer ratio method.
